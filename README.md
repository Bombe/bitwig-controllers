# Bitwig Controller Scripts

This repository contains all controller scripts that I have created for various MIDI controllers.
Most of these controllers were never meant to control DAWs and it shows.

This repository holds controller scripts for the following controllers:

* Behringer Xenyx UFX1204: this is not a controller but a mixer which has a small transport section (consisting of five buttons).

All scripts have been written for and tested with Bitwig Studio 1.3.
